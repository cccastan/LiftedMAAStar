===========================
Installing the MADP Toolbox

Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
===========================

Get the MADP Toolbox from https://github.com/MADPToolbox/MADP

If not already installed:
  - $ sudo apt install g++
  - $ sudo apt install make
  
Install libtool:
  - $ sudo apt install libtool
  
Install optional packages required to run 'make check' without errors:
  - $ sudo apt install libxml2-dev
  - $ sudo apt install liblpsolve55-dev
  - If not already installed:
    $ sudo apt install libsuitesparse-dev
    (replaces libufsparse-dev [deprecated], which is required according to MADP documentation)

Compile in MADP-master directory:
  - $ sh autogen.sh
  - $ ./configure
  - $ make  (probably followed by pages of warnings regarding auto_ptr; can be ignored)

Test in madp-master directory:
  - $ make check  (should run without errors, otherwise see src/tests/test-suite.log)

Installation (moves all files to the correct locations):
  - $ sudo make install
  (see MADP docs for custom install directory, default <PATHTOMADP> = /usr/local)

Check Boost installation:
  - Boost library is supposed to be installed with MADP, which may fail
  - Check if /usr/include/boost exists, otherwise:
  - $ sudo apt install libboost-dev

Usage as library:
  - Compiling:
    - $ g++ -o <NAME> <FILE>.cpp -I <PATHTOMADP>/include/madp -L <PATHTOMADP>/lib -lMADP
    - default <PATHTOMADP> = /usr/local
    - Note: '/madp' after '/include' is missing in the MADP-docs
  - Execute compiled program: $ ./<NAME>
